=Using arduinoscope=

Arduinoscope is very much a DIY sort of tool.  It makes it easy to set it up however is useful.  The included processing patch is just a simple example of using the Scope class, and can be used a lot of different ways.

Here is what it looks like reading 6 analog inputs:

To set the number of scopes, in the example patch, find the line that reads
{{{
Scope[] scopes = new Scope[6];
}}}
and change 6 to how many ever you want.  The arduino patch included sends the 6 analog ports on the first 6 places, and 12 digital pins, after that (2-13, all but 0 & 1 - serial)

If you wanted an all digital scope, for example, you could do this:
{{{
Scope[] scopes = new Scope[12];
}}}

in setup() set the ranges, in the loop over scopes:
{{{
// find this:
scopes[i] = new Scope(posv, dimv, color((int)random(255), (int)random(127)+127, 255));

// set range to something more useful:
scopes[i].multiplier = 1.0f;
scopes[i].resolution = 1.0f;

}}}

and in draw() function, change:
{{{
scopes[i].addData(vals[i]);
}}}
to
{{{
scopes[i].addData(vals[i+6]);
}}}

If this seems confusing, I will make some example configurations, for different things that I can imagine being useful.
