=Using arduinoscope=

Arduinoscope is very much a DIY sort of tool.  It makes it easy to set it up however is useful.  The included processing patch is just a simple example of using the Scope class, and can be used a lot of different ways.

Here is what it looks like reading 6 analog inputs:

To set the number of scopes, in the example patch, find the line that reads
{{{
Oscilloscope[] scopes = new Oscilloscope[6];
}}}
and change 6 to how many ever you want.  [http://code.google.com/p/arduinoscope/source/browse/trunk/arduino_oscilliscope.pde The arduino patch] sends the 6 analog ports on the first 6 places, and 12 digital pins, after that (2-13, all but 0 & 1 - serial)

If you wanted an all digital scope, for example, you could do this:
{{{
Oscilloscope[] scopes = new Oscilloscope[12];
}}}

in setup() set the ranges, in the loop over scopes:
{{{
// find this:
scopes[i] = new Oscilloscope(posv, dimv, color((int)random(255), (int)random(127)+127, 255));

// set range to something more useful:
scopes[i].multiplier = 1.0f;
scopes[i].resolution = 1.0f;

}}}

and in draw() function, change:
{{{
scopes[i].addData(vals[i]);
}}}
to
{{{
scopes[i].addData(vals[i+6]);
}}}

==Higher samplerates==
The arduino isn't really designed to be accurate at very high sample-rates (200khz recommended ADC clock rate in specs.) Also, processing probably doesn't run fast enough on your computer to really keep up with it.

That being said, check out [http://gabuku.com/scope/ this project]. gabebear has some good ideas about a more efficient serial data format, that has a sort of error-correction, which might be a nice thing to add to your own processing+arduino patch.

See [http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1208715493/11 this] for ideas on getting the arduino to read analog faster. Once you start getting up into super-high numbers, you probably should be using a DSP, or something, though.
