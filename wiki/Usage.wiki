=Using arduinoscope=

Arduinoscope is very much a DIY sort of tool.  It makes it easy to set it up however is useful.  The included processing patch is just a simple example of using the Scope class, and can be used a lot of different ways.

Here is what it looks like reading 6 analog inputs:

To set the number of scopes, in the example patch, find the line that reads
{{{
Scope[] scopes = new Scope[6];
}}}
and change 6 to how many ever you want.  The arduino patch included sends the 6 analog ports on the first 6 places, and most of the digital pins, after that.
